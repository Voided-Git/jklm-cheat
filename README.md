# JKLM Cheat
A simple cheat for the web game JKLM's Bomb Party gamemode. This comes with no warranty, what happens to your access to the game is entirely your responsibility.

### Getting started
- Load `jklm-cheat.exe` and once it says `Initialised...`, go on the input box on JKLM, press the key selected as the `escape_key` in `config.json` (default is <kbd>/</kbd>).
- Type the prompt given (for example `ali`) and press the key selected as the `confirm_key` in `config.json` (default is <kbd>-</kbd>).
- Now if the first word doesn't get accepted or has already been used, press any key until the word is accepted, then press the key selected as the `confirm_key` again.
- The cheat will wait for the key selected as the `escape_key` to send more messages.

### The Config
- `escape_key` : the key that will initialise reading the prompt
- `confirm_key` : the key used to confirm the prompt and to stop the sending of other messages
- `sfx` : whether you want sounds enabled or not (recommended as `true`)
